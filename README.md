## Projects
### * NLP: Sentiment Analysis on YouTube comments for brand image improvement with Deployment on Heroku using flask
• Scraping comments on Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's official film available on YouTube using Python 
• Labelling data as positive or negative based on polarity scores
• Transforming data: Using lemmatization module; converting alphabets to lower case; removing new lines, punctuations, special characters, stop words; tokenization 
• Encoding: Labels to numerical form; comments to vectors using TfidfVectorizer 
• Balancing the dataset 
• Machine Learning model: Splitting the data into train and test set, feeding the data to Support Vector Classifier 
• Model pipeline: Creating a pipeline which passes the data first into TfidfVectorizer and then to SVClassifier 
• Model evaluation using accuracy score 
• Saving the model pipeline as pickle file 
• Making index.html and flask app(app.py) 
• Committing the files to Github 
• Creating an app on Heroku and connecting it to Github repository 
• Model deployment on Heroku
### * Power BI - Global Superstore Analysis Dashboard
Steps Covered:
Connecting Database with Power BI Desktop.
Analysing the tables and relations.
Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). and ultimately
Developing an Interactive BI Dashboard / Report.
Insights:
Identified top 10 customers, top 6 profit making products, top 6 loss making products

Visualization: Sum of sales by region on map
### * Telangana Kharif(Vaanakalam) Season Rainfall Prediction
Every year, the Kharif (Vaanakalam) season starts from June(Mrigasira Karti) in Telangana State.
The main crops cultivated in kharif season are Paddy, all varieties of Millets, all varieties of Pulses and Jowar which requires a moderate/normal rainfall for better yield.
The farmers of Telangana state will be waiting with expectation of normal and moderate rainfall which will help them for sowing the seeds in Mrigasira Karti with the onset of monsoon in June every year.
The objective is to find best model among Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost, Support Vector Classifier that predicts whether it will rain significantly or not based on meteorological measurements.
The dataset is originally from the Telangana's Open Data Platform.
### * Linear Discriminant Analysis in Python on Diabetes Dataset
The objective is to develop a model that predicts based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. Imputed nul values using MICE. Split the data into train and test set using Twinning technique. Model evaluation and accuracy using F1 score metric.
### * Logistic Regression with Categorical Predictor in Python
The objective is to develop a logistic regression model that predicts whether a student wil get admitted based on gpa, gre score and prestige of institution. Creating Dummy variables. Split the data into train and test set using Twinning technique. Model evaluation and accuracy using F1 score metric because it's an imbalanced dataset
### * Multiple Linear Regression Model and Regression Diagnostics in RStudio
Creating a multiple linear regression model while taking the independent variables as money spent on three advertising medias(youtube, facebook and newspaper) and dependent variable as sales of a product using marketing dataset and also making sure the presumptions of Ordinary Least Squares Regression are adhered to.
